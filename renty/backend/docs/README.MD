## About
What Inspired This Project

Since childhood, I've been passionate about music, and I've come to realize how deeply music unites people from different backgrounds. My journey as a musician made me aware of the lack of digital resources available to musicians, especially for accessing rentals, buying, and selling of instruments. This project was born from my desire to bridge that gap by creating a platform where musicians can connect, find resources, and access features that make musical instruments more accessible.
